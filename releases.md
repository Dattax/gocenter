## 2019 June 12: Module information in search results
In this release, module metadata will be displayed as part of search results.

## 2019 June 6: Improved search functionality
In this release, GoCenter has enriched the search functionality which includes most relevant Go modules in search results.

## 2019 March 27: Enhanced automatic inclusion of Go modules 
In this release, GoCenter has enhanced the automatic inclusion of Go modules
* GoCenter will now automatically attempt to include missing Go modules that were requested at least once
* This means that if a user tries to retrieve a dependency from GoCenter, but receives a 404 error (“Not Found”) because the module does not yet exist in GoCenter, a background process in GoCenter will eventually try to include that module through the [Inclusion Request process](https://github.com/jfrog/gocenter/wiki/How-GoCenter-Works#inclusion-process). 
* This feature will enhance the user experience of GoCenter as a Go proxy by reducing the occurrence of 404 errors in your builds.

## 2019 March 14: Updated logic for generating mod files 
In this release, GoCenter has changed the logic of mod files generation. 
* GoCenter will no longer generate a populated go.mod file for Go projects that haven’t yet opted into modules and do not yet contain a go.mod file. Prior to this release, GoCenter was using a different approach to produce missing go.mod files, to achieve optimal reproducibility. However, after further discussion with the Go community, and considering that the initial approach may cause the go.mod file’s checksum to be different from what may have been recorded in a project’s go.sum before using GoCenter, GoCenter will now generate empty go.mod files for Go projects that haven’t yet opted into modules.
* As part of this release, go.mod files that were previously generated by GoCenter will be converted to be consistent with this new behavior.
* For Go projects that already have go.mod files, GoCenter will continue to keep these .mod files unchanged when processing them to be included in GoCenter.

## 2019 January 28: GA
* gocenter.io goes live!
* Basic ability to search for modules
* Basic ability to request new modules be added to GoCenter
* Basic ability to determine the status of a module/version
